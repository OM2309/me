## Why?

**You may ask why I am writing this blog.**  
**What is my expertise?**  
**What is the purpose of this blog?**

## Introduction

I have been working as a frontend developer for the past 2 years and have learned a lot along the way.  
I have seen many developers struggling with frontend development and design principles.

So, I thought: why not share my knowledge with all of you?

In this blog, I will share some key principles that every frontend developer should know. So, let's get started.

> First of all, pardon me if I make any mistakes in this blog. I am not a native English speaker and I am an amateur blogger.

## Rule 1: Needs over design

**Don't be like a typical developer** who opens VS Code, creates a Next.js app, deletes everything, and stares at a blank screen wondering about navbars and colors.

**STOP. STOP. STOP.**

Take a step back.  
Think about the **user's needs** first.

Grab a pen and paper and write down:

- What is this project about?
- Who is the target audience?
- What problem are we solving?

### Example: Flight Booking App

You don’t need animations.  
You need: **a working search**.

<Button variant="outline" className="mt-6">Focus on needs → Design follows</Button>

---

## Rule 2: Improve Incrementally

Don’t chase perfection on day one.

Don’t waste time picking:
- The perfect font
- The exact shade of blue
- Subtle hover effects

**Build a functional product first.** Then polish.

---

## Rule 3: Hierarchy is everything

Start with **grayscale**.  
Force yourself to nail spacing, font weights, and visual hierarchy **before** adding color.

Then add color:

## Rule 4: Don't design too much

Don’t try to design every edge case in Figma.

Instead:
1. Design a simple version
2. Build it
3. See what breaks
4. Fix it in real code

**Build early. Fix fast.**

---

## Final Words

These 4 rules changed everything for me:

1. **Needs > Design**
2. **Improve incrementally**
3. **Hierarchy first**
4. **Build early**

Stay tuned for Part 2!
